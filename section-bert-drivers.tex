\subsection{mlbert}

This driver is intended to connect via the
\href{https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-mlbert-bridge}{scopehal-mlbert-bridge} server for network transparency
and does not directly link to the MultiLANE SDK or talk directly to the instrument. The bridge requires a Windows PC
since MultiLANE's SDK is Windows only, however the libscopehal clientside driver can run on any supported OS.

It was developed using a ML4039 but may work with other similar models as well.
